# Extended Euclidian Algorithm

  In Computer Science the extended Euclidian algorithm is an extension to the Euclidian Algorithm, and computes, in addition to the greatest common divisor of integers a and b,
  also the coefficients of Bezout's identity, which are the integers x and y such that ax + by = gcd(a,b).
